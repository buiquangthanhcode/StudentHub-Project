# StudentHub Project
The aim of StudentHub is to create a comprehensive app that facilitates connections between students seeking real-world projects and companies in search of talent to develop their MVP.
The features include:
- Creation of profiles by students, businesses, and mentors.
- Project postings by companies to find engineers or teams.
- Application to projects by students or teams.
- Companies can view candidate lists, arrange interviews, and make project offers.
- Direct communication between candiates and companies.
- Invitation of mentors or professors by students to guide them on a project, potentially as a final thesis.
- Formation of teams by students, who can invite members to join and submit projects collectively rather than individually.
The application will be available on Android, iOS, and as a web version, with its development structured into four phases: MVP (Phase 1), V0.2 (Phase 2), V0.3 (Phase 3), and V1.0 (Phase 4).
